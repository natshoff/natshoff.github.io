## About Me
![me + bog ol' oak](img/nate_tree.JPG)
I am a Project Manager for the Balch Fire Lab and The North Central Regional Invasive Species and Climate Change ([NC RISCC](https://nc-riscc.org/)). Prior to joining the Balch Fire Lab, I worked at the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) as a botanist in the [Southeast US](https://www.neonscience.org/impact/observatory-blog/getting-know-neon-domains-ozarks-complex). My previous research focused on assessing genomic variation and habitat suitability for the invasive species, Johnsongrass (*Sorghum halepense*). I received my MS in Biology from the University of Alabama, and my BS in Evolution and Ecology from Ohio State University.

## Data Exploration
Below are assignments from the CU Boulder Earth Analytics Data Science Course

### Mapping Greater sage-grouse occurrence across BLM Habitat Management Areas (HMAs)
The Greater sage-grouse (*Centrocercus urophasianus*) is a threatened species endemic to the Sagebrush steppe ecosystem of Western North America [ref]. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages the largest share of Greater sage-grouse habitat in the United States, a total of 65 million acres [refs]. I investigated Greater sage-grouse occurrence patterns across BLM land using Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data to assess if high occurrence was associated with high-priority BLM habitat.

#### Who is the Greater sage-grouse?

Male Greater sage-grouse maintain mating territories called "leks", and display the behavior "lekking" shown in the video above during mating season.

Sage grouse are sagebrush obligates that depend on sagebrush for food, cover, and mating grounds. These birds are an indicator species for other sagebrush obligates like the pygmy rabbit, sagebrush vole, sage thrasher and sage sparrow [(USGS, 2011)](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/chapter-2-sagebrush-associated-species-conservation-concern). Sagebrush habitat it being lost to development, invasive grass spread, and woody encroachment. Habitat loss has lead to Greater sage-grouse populations have declining by 78.8 % since 1960 [(Prochazka et al., 2025)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/dr1217). 

#### How do BLM HMAs work?
It's more confusing than you might initially guess. BLM organizes Greater sage-grouse land into Habitat Management Areas (HMAs) based on **regional** Environmental Impact Assessments (EIS) which are assigned a **habitat type** based on the quality of the land and intended management actions. Different BLM **regions** use different **habitat type** verbage to describe the goals of their HMAs. 

Here is how the BLM divides regional HMAs:

***Figure 1:*** BLM HMAs colored by region.

Below is a table with the different assigned **habitat types** and my intepretation of their relative priorities based on nation-wide BLM language [ref]. **Important note:** these are not BLM-sanctioned "priorities", rather they are my attempt to simplify a multitude of acronyms, and are inferred from reading through BLM Greater Sage-Grouse Habitat Management Area Stateby-State Mapping Strategies [refs].

**Habitat Types in our data**

| Acronym | Full Name | Region of Use | Assigned Priority Tier |
| ------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| PHMA | Priority Habitat Management Area | Range-wide | High |
| IHMA | Important Habitat Management Area | ID, MT | High |
| AM | Anthro Mountain Habitat Management Area | UT | High |
| GHMA | General Habitat Management Area | Range-wide | Medium |
| LCHMA | Linkage and Connectivity Habitat Management Area | CO | Medium |
| RHMA | Restoration Habitat Management Area | MT, ND, SD | Low |
| OHMA | Other Habitat Management Area | NV, CA | Low |

***Table 1:*** BLM habtiat type designations (acronyms), the regions these terms are applied to, and their assigned priority tier generated by looking at the Nation-wide BLM Greater sgae-grouse management plan [BLM, 2024](https://www.blm.gov/programs/fish-and-wildlife/sagegrouse/blm-sagegrouse-plans/2024-habitat-management-areas).

INSERT PRIORITY MAP HERE
***Figure 2:*** BLM HMAs colored by **my** assigned priority.

Mapping low, medium, and high priority areas reveals a distinct spatial pattern in habitat priority. Nevada and north eastern California have the highest amount of "low quality" habitat. In BLM speak, these areas are "Other Habitat Management Area", where either (1) there is little information known about Greater sage-grouse habitat, or (2) the habitat is degraded in quality [BLM, 2015](https://eplanning.blm.gov/public_projects/2016719/200502020/20122939/251022919/Appendix_03_GRSG_HMA_Strategy_Summaries_508.pdf#:~:text=Priority%20habitat%20(PHMA)%20includes%20areas%20with%20relatively,maintaining%20the%20extent%20of%20the%20GRSG%20range.). Nevada faces challenges in habtiat loss from both invasive annual grasses [refs] and mining development [refs], which both impact the quality of Greater sage-grouse habitat quality [refs].

#### GBIF occurrence data
I queried GBIF for all Greater sage-grouse observations between 2015 and 2024. Examining the raw yearly occurrence data reveals increasing yearly observations and "hotspots" where there are consistently high observtions (Figure 3). 

INSERT RAW GBIF OBSERVATIONS HERE
***Figure 3:*** Raw number of GBIF observations (colored hexagons) across BLM management areas (light grey outlines).

#### Let's normalize
I calculated a normalized occurrence value to account for changes in yearly increases in the number of Greater sage-grouse observations and the hot-spots we saw in the raw data. 

$$
\text{norm\_occurrences} = \frac{\text{density}}{\text{mean\_occurrences\_by\_year}} \div \text{mean\_occurrences\_by\_hma}
$$

Normalization will help us account for both variation in the number of occurrence records per year and the size difference between the different areas. Both are shown here summed by priority level instead of HMA.

INSERT NORMALIZED OCCURRENCE FIGURE
***Figure 5:*** Normalized occurrence data for each BLM HMA between 2016 and 2025. 

We see substanail variation in occurrence across the HMAs year-to-year. Generally, we see higher occurrence in the higher priority, core Wyoming habitat, but this is not consistent throughout the record. The absence of a clear pattern could suggest our normaliztion is not accouting for the skewed nature of our data (higher observations in later years, hot-spot near Coalmont, CO). It could also reflect variation in ease of access for sampling Greater sage-grouse. Sagebrush habitat can be extremely remote and most GBIF observations come from citizen science platforms like e-bird and iNaturalist, our sampling here is not even across the sagebrush. 



### Gila River Region - Agricultural NDVI
The Akimel O’‘otham and Tohono O’’odham tribes of the Gila River region in south-central Arizona had 653,500 acre-feet of water annually restored to their use in 2004 [[1]](https://www.justice.gov/enrd/indian-resources-section/gila-river-indian-community). Using remotely sensed vegetation health data from [MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod13.php) and landuse from the [Annual National Land Cover Database (NLCD)](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/annual-national-land-cover-database), I investiagted the impact of this settlement on the cultivated croplands of the region. **Note:** See the code that created these figures and a deeper explanation of the methods [here](https://natshoff.github.io/portfolioPosts/vegetation-05-portfolio.html)!

#### Changing Croplands in the Gila River Region

***Figure 3:** Difference in NDVI inside and outside the Gila Tribal Area. Green bars represent years where the Tribal NDVI > surrounding area, and red bars represent years where Tribal Area NDVI < surrounding area.*

#### **Conclusions**
When assessing the impact of restoring water rights to the Akimel O’‘otham and Tohono O’’odham people, cropland NDVI tells an incomplete story. When comparing annual mean NDVI for inside the Gila Tribal lands and the surrounding area, Gila crops had a higher NDVI 17 out of 22 years for the study period (Fig. 3). This makes it seem as if there were no signal of increased plant health on Gila lands from restoring water rights. This lack of signal could instead be explained by tribal ares prioritizing water to agricultural production, both before and after winning their settlement. What is a better indicator of these restored right on Gila crop production is in the expanded land use when comparing 2001 and 2021 NLCD cover classes. While areas surrounding Gila **lost** cropland, Gila lands **gained or maintained** cropland (Fig. 1).

This is only part of the complicated story about the possible impact that restoring water rights has on a community. Additional analyses could focus on non-agricultural or non-irrigated land to see if these vegetation types are healthier as a result of greater access to water.


### American Golden Plover Migration Mapping
Investigating the migration patterns of the American golden plover (*Pluvialis dominica*), a bird with an ~24,000 km (~15,000 miles) long yearly migration journey [(1)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.710007/full). Their southern migration route even contains a 3000-5000 km stretch of flight that is entirely over the Atlantic Ocean, meaning these birds cannot stop to rest or feed during this time [(2)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1366605?casa_token=wtKsQEdXUHwAAAAA%3AM9SB-dQYZ8tHxZH8ErOAosejJCVK5YAF-7ZFgPzXZKqZGBY9flhzqmcCUrz53s2OdZ3rIriJK7n8rJ4yHzNZswPSChv3XFyVbuYgkGRfKBKrE2006hqF).

#### How do these three sources for migration information on the American golden plover compare?
**Birds of the World and Brad:** We can see clearly that Brad Harris and Birds of the World are on the same page. The map shows that the American golden plover spends it's non-breeding overwintering time in northern Argentina, and migrates through both Guatemala and Illinois on it's way to breed in the tundra. 

**How does our map agree?** Our map broadly agrees! We see winter (Dec - Feb) plover observations concentrated in southern South America. Migrating birds reach the Tundra by May and don't leave until August. Their overflight takes them through Guatemala and Illinois. Notably, this timing agrees with other published timings of American golden plover migration. For example, a conservation plan by [Clay et al., 2010](https://whsrn.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/conservationplan_amgp_v1.1._2010.pdf) notes that plovers start migrating south from their breeding habitat in late June to mid-July (these are failed breeders), with the majority of the adults leaving in August. They also note that August is the first month where birds arrive on non-breeding grounds, which also agrees with our map. There is also agreement with literature on the birds northern migration. Clay et al state that birds start leaving non-breeding ground in late January, with most leaving in February. Some birds even stick around in South American until April and May, which our map also shows. April is major influx of birds in the Missouri, Mississippi, and Ohio River valleys. Plovers arrive on breeding grounds starting in mind-May to early June, which our maps clearly show. 

**How does our map disagree?** Our map is possibly overestimating the range of the American golden plover. You can see that the overwinter observations of the plover (see January) extend all the way to the southern tip of South America. It is certainly possible that some birds migrate this far south, but our map might be affected in part by the size of the ecoregions we're using to bin occurrences. For example, if a bird was spotten in the northern area of the one of the southern-Argentinian ecoregions, the entire ecoregion will be filled. The same pattern can be seen in the Artic tundra ecoregions. Finer spatial resolution binning could improve this.

**Something cool to note:** There is a small population of American golden plovers in Europe. While some of these might be misidentifications of European golden plovers (*Pluvialis apricaria*), we can observe a similar (albeit much small scale) version of the plover migration. Overwintering populations migrate to the northern Spain August - November, and spend the summer in the UK.
