## About Me
![me + bog ol' oak](img/nate_tree.JPG)
I am a Project Manager for the Balch Fire Lab and The North Central Regional Invasive Species and Climate Change ([NC RISCC](https://nc-riscc.org/)). Prior to joining the Balch Fire Lab, I worked at the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) as a botanist in the [Southeast US](https://www.neonscience.org/impact/observatory-blog/getting-know-neon-domains-ozarks-complex). My previous research focused on assessing genomic variation and habitat suitability for the invasive species, Johnsongrass (*Sorghum halepense*). I received my MS in Biology from the University of Alabama, and my BS in Evolution and Ecology from Ohio State University.
